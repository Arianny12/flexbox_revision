        <p>Hospitals claim that they are able to provide valid methods of communication to deaf people, but what they provide is largely useless. In 2018, two deaf parents had no idea that their son was dying in front of them because the hospitals denied them access to an interpreter. After it was too late they provided an interpreter but their son ended up dying in front of them (Communication Service for the Deaf). They sued the hospital for not providing equal communication access but they lost the lawsuit because a part of the Americans with Disabilities Act states that “a hospital need not provide communication aids or services if doing so would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods or services offered or would result in an undue burden” (U.S. Department of Justice). This case perfectly exemplifies a problem in the Americans with Disabilities Act, creating ambiguity in the law which could cause healthcare systems to take advantage of it and would lead to not equally protecting those who are deaf.

        <p>CODA do not have a lot of knowledge when it comes to using signed medical terms. As a CODA, I have experienced injustices made by those in this field, laughing and treating others as if they were less, without the power to take action due to being underage. A minor should not be interpreting for their deaf parents because it should not be any child’s responsibility to interpret when public facilities are required by law to do; bringing an interpreter. Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act establishes that healthcare facilities are prohibited to “rely on a minor child to interpret or facilitate communication, except in an emergency ”. There has been multiple occasions where I was asked to interpret for my mother although an appointment had been made previously, giving the hospital enough time to acquire an interpreter for the appointment. Hospitals should not rely on chuldren becuase the smallest misinterpretation can cause a disastrous outcome for patients. Hospitals breaking the law can damage the patient and their children, when asking a minor for interpretation. This also places to account for issues of competency, confidentiality, privacy, and other conflicts of interest that arise when providers rely on informal or untrained interpreters to facilitate communication. Hospitals do not provide enough privacy to delicate information when making the patient child interpret.
